## The struggles

"This is too frustrating", is what I thought when implementing ESLint on my codes. I need a space here. I don't need a space here. I need a newline here, but you can't put one here. Following these strict rules on my code is such a hassle, especially during WODs. I am the type of person where if I see an error, I try to fix it first before moving on to the next task. So seeing these redlines and errors on my editor makes me panic since I feel like I'd be spending most of my time resolving theses so called errors. For example, while I was working on today's WOD, I was trying to return the average values in an array. Since we're expected to use underscore functions, I attempted to do calculate the average of the numbers all in one line. I was pretty familiar on how to do it from previous practice WODs from JSFiddle. But with the strict rules of ESLint where there is a max of 80 characters in one line, I was forced to initialize a variable which would take the total of all the numbers in the array then return that variable divided by the length of the array. Seeing this rule made me VERY frustrated. I just couldn't follow this coding standard anymore.
