## A Programmer's Coookbook

Design patterns are like the seasoned recipes of a chef's cookbook. Just as a skilled chef relies on well-established recipes to create a delicious dish, software developers turn to design patterns to craft a robust and efficient solutions to recurring problems in software design. Thses patterns serve as time-tested templates that encapsulates the collective wisdom of the development community, offering proven approaches to common challenges. Just as a chef might alter recipes to suit the specific ingredient in store, develops adapt and apply design patterns to meet the unique requirements of their project. In both cooking and coding, these patterns provide a structured organized way to appriach problems, fostering creativity within a framework of established best practices.

## Spot-A-Scholar

Design pattern that my team and I have used is the base template. We used the Bowfolios template that was available to us. We chose the Bowfolios because it had a similar structure to that of our program, Jamb-UH-ree. The main component from Bowfolios was the structure card and features like the note stime stamp and joining. We filled the structure with our data and changed the template. From this point, we were able to implement other key features. This method saved us a lot of time and saved us from starting from scratch. Without this template our team would have taken the majority of our project time on just set up.
