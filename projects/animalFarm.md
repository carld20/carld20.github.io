summary: "Create a database of animals where each characteristics can be updated and modified."
---

Animal Farm was a series of projects created while I was taking EE205: Object Oriented Programming. The purpose of this series of projects was to learn the coding languages C and C++ while creating a database of animals where each animal's weight, gender, color, type, and name can be set, changed, and updated overtime.

The first Animal Farm project was a small database where a handful amount of animals were added with it's chosen characteristics using while being built through VIM. As time progressed the latest animalFarm project became more complexed where the size of the database got larger with more features added and moved from VIM to CLion. Having to work on this project through an IDE allows us to upload the codes written using git. The last animalFarm was coded to implement classes, where I got to learn the importance of objects and inheritance.
