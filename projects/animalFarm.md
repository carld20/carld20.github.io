summary: "Create a database of animals where each characteristics can be updated and modified."
---

Animal Farm was a series of projects created while I was taking EE205: Object Oriented Programming. The purpose of this series of projects was to learn the coding languages C and C++ create a database of animal where each animal's weight, gender, color, type, and name can be changed, and updated overtime.

The first animalFarm project was a small database where a handful amount of animals were added with it's chosen characteristics. As time progressed the latest animalFarm project became more complexed where the size of the database got larger with more features added. The last animalFarm was also coded to implement classes, where I got to learn the importance of objects and inheritance.
