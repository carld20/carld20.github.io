In this project we created a python script that integrated the UAV Hardware subsytem, Image processing system, and Air Delivery subsystem to allow the drone to perform a competition ready mission. We also created a data transfer system where the drone would send the photos taken during a mission to the ground station controller for the computer to run Image Processing subsystem's object detection algorithm. Once the objects have been correctly identified, the drone would fly to the targets and trigger Air Delivery subsystem's payload drop mechanism to deliver the appropriate payload to the corresponding target.
